<div class="maintitle">THE WIG<br />

<small>AND<br />

THE SHOULDER OF MUTTON.</small></div>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="378" height="271" alt="boy talking to two girls and boy" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Friendly</span> was one afternoon at
home, and in the drawing-room with
his four children, Lambert, Charlotte,
Dorothy, and Felix, when three gentlemen,
whose names were Vernon,
Fairfield, and Fitzwilliam, came to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
him. The children loved them greatly,
and were rejoiced to see them.
They would always listen to their conversation
with a greedy ear, because
it was both amusing and instructive;
and on this occasion sat till the night
came on, without perceiving that they
wanted candles. Mr. Vernon was
relating a very curious circumstance
that happened to him in his travels,
when a singular noise was heard from
the second flight of stairs. The children
crowded together in a fright, behind
their father, instead of going to
see what was the matter, as they ought
to have done. Mr. Vernon bid his
eldest son, Lambert, step out; but
Lambert passed the order to his sister
Charlotte; Charlotte to Dorothy; and
Dorothy passed it on to Felix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" width="386" height="274" alt="children huddled behind man seated at table with two other men" />
</div>

<p>All this was transacted in a moment.
Mr. Friendly eyed them with a look,
which seemed to ask if he or his friends
should take the trouble to rise, and see
what accident had happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" width="376" height="276" alt="four children walking" />
</div>

<p>Upon this, the four began their
march towards the door, in the figure
of a square, each supported by the
other. They were now come near the
door, when Lambert, with a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
step, advanced and opened it; but
instantly fell back into his former
place. The little ones were terrified
on seeing an apparition clothed in
white, crawling along. In short, our
heroes uttered a shriek, and retreated
towards their father, who rose from
his seat, went to the door to ascertain
the cause, and asked who was there.</p>

<p>“I, sir!” replied a voice, that appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to issue from some part of the
flooring.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="389" height="270" alt="Mr. Friendly holding candle, chidlren behind him, boy on floor, man in doorway" />
</div>

<p>“I!” said Mr. Friendly, “and pray
who are you?”</p>

<p>“The barber’s boy, sir, looking for
your wig.”</p>

<p>Think, little friends, what bursts of
laughter now succeeded their preceding
silence. Mr. Friendly rang the
bell for a light, and when it came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
perceived the wig-box broken, and
the unfortunate wig entangled about
the boy’s right foot.</p>

<p>The father now asked his children
what they had been afraid of. They
could not tell, and really felt ashamed;
for they had been accustomed from
their infancy not to be afraid of being
in the dark; and the servants were
expressly forbidden to tell them any
foolish stories about ghosts or goblins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="373" height="273" alt="girl looking in mirror while another girl looks at her" />
</div>

<p>The preceding conversation being
thus deranged, it came at last to turn
upon this subject: what could occasion
those surprising fears, so common
to all children, particularly on going
to bed in the dark?</p>

<p>“It is the natural effects of darkness,
and that only,” answered Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Vernon; “as children cannot properly
distinguish objects around them
in the dark, their imagination, which
is always smitten with the marvellous,
shapes them out extraordinary figures,
by enlarging or contracting what they
look at, just as circumstances govern.
Upon this, the notion of their weakness
easily persuades them they are
utterly unable to resist those monsters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which they think armed to hurt
them. Terror thus obtains possession
of them, and too frequently impresses
fears which have the worst consequences.”</p>

<p>“They would be ashamed,” said
Mr. Friendly, “if they saw in open
day what often gives them so much
fright by night.”</p>

<p>“It was for all the world,” said
Lambert, “just as if I saw it; but I
needed only touch it, and then I knew
very well what it was.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Charlotte, “you
have given us a very admirable proof
of your courage. Needed only touch
it! And therefore, I suppose, you
would have had me touch the door, but
that I pushed you forward.”</p>

<p>“It becomes you well to talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
my fear,” said Lambert; “you that
got behind poor Felix.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="373" height="273" alt="four children running, one boy holding the hand of the littler girl" />
</div>

<p>“And poor little Dorothy behind
me,” added the sly Felix.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Mr. Friendly, “I
can see you have nothing to reproach
each other with. But Lambert’s notion
is not, upon that account, less
rational; for, as in all the monstrous
shapes that we image out continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to ourselves, we have but natural accidents
to fear, we may ward off all
danger by the sense of feeling, which
distinguishes what frequently deceives
the sight. It is the neglect of this
precaution in our infancy, that makes
so many of us fancy ghosts in every
object round about us. I remember
on this head, a story, comical enough,
which I will tell you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="384" height="275" alt="three girls and boy talking to seated man" />
</div>

<p>The four children now came round
their father, crying out, “A story!
oh, a story!” and their father thus
began it:—</p>

<p>“In my father’s house, there lived
a maid-servant, who one night was
sent for beer into the cellar. We were
all seated at the table, but could not
set eyes upon the servant or beer.
My mother, who was rather of a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
temper, rose from table, and went out
to call her. As it chanced, the cellar
door was open, but she could not
make the servant hear. My mother
ordered me to bring a candle, and go
down into the cellar with her. I went
first to light the way: but as I looked
straight forward, and did not mind
my steps, all at once I fell over something
rather soft. My light went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and getting up, I put my hand upon
another hand, quite motionless and
cold, which caused me to give an involuntary
shriek. Upon the cry that
I uttered, down came the cook-maid
with a candle. They drew near, and
we discovered the poor girl stretched
all along upon the ground, face downward,
in a swoon. We raised her up,
and let her have a smelling-bottle.
She recovered her spirits, but had
hardly lifted up her eyes, when she
cried out: ‘There! there! she is
there still.’ ‘Who is there?’ replied
my mother. ‘That tall woman in
white,’ answered she, ‘there, standing
in the corner. See! see! see!’
We looked the way that she pointed;
and really did see, as she described it,
somewhat white and of a tolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
length, suspended in a corner. ‘Is it
only that?’ replied the cook-maid,
bursting out a laughing, ‘why that is
nothing but a <small>SHOULDER OF MUTTON</small>,
which I bought last night. I hung it
there, that it might be quite fresh and
cool, and put a napkin round it, to
keep off the flies.’ She immediately
took off the napkin, and exhibited the
shoulder of mutton to her fellow servant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
who stood trembling with terror.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="384" height="274" alt="boy, two maids and cook; cook is holding the shoulder of mutton" />
</div>

<p>“It was about a quarter of an hour
before she was convinced of her ridiculous
mistake. She would at first
insist upon it, that the phantom stared
her in the face with saucer eyes; that
she had turned to run away, but that
the ghost had followed her, fastened
on her petticoat, and seized upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
candle in her hand. What happened
after this, she could not tell.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="372" height="269" alt="girl with basket standing outside door" />
</div>

<p>“It is very easy to explain all this,”
said Mr. Vernon: “and assign the
reason why your servant fancied thus
extravagantly. When the fright first
seized her and she swooned, the circulation
of the blood was stopped,
and she could not run away; so she
thought that she had been held. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
limbs were deprived of their strength,
so that she could not hold the candle,
and therefore supposed that the spectre
took it from her.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="376" height="270" alt="girl knocking on door" />
</div>

<p>“We are happy,” added he, “that
the understanding and good sense of
people have begun to dissipate these
foolish notions concerning ghosts and
goblins. There was once a time of
so much ignorance, that these ideas,
mixed with superstitious notions, had
deprived the boldest of their courage;
but, thank heaven, they are now almost
done away in towns; though
they exist now, in the country, where
it is not at all uncommon to hear of
witches, and evil spirits.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwilliam remarked, that many
boys took delight in frightening their
playmates, not thinking of the ill effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that generally attend such pastime.
I have myself been very lately
told of an unhappy incident, which
shows how terribly the effects of fear
may act on children. I will tell you
the tale, my little friends, and I hope
the story will not fail to cure you of
a wish to frighten one another when
it is dark, if ever you give way to
such a practice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="383" height="274" alt="man and older man sitting at table" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Charles Pomroy, a lad of great
vivacity and understanding, had such
a natural turn for music, that besides
his daily lesson on the organ, which
his master came to give him every
morning, he would go at night upon
a visit to his master, who resided in
the neighbourhood, and there repeat
it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="383" height="269" alt="Augustus and Charles playing" />
</div>

<p>“Charles’s brother Augustus was a
good boy likewise, but had something
of a turn towards drollery: he spent
the time, when Charles was busy at
his book, in scheming how he might
play off some trick or other, no ways
minding who became the object of his
waggery. He took notice that his
brother frequently came home alone,
and sometimes when it was dark; so
he turned his thoughts upon a contrivance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to frighten him a little. He
could walk in stilts. One evening,
therefore, at the same time that his
brother was expected home, he put
himself into a pair of very high ones,
wrapped a great white sheet about
him, which trailed far behind upon
the ground; and took a broad-brimmed
hat, which first of all he flapped,
and having covered it with crape of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
sufficient length to hang a great way
down on every side, but most of all
before him, put it on his head. Thus
frightfully equipped, he placed himself
upright, and at a little distance
from the house, close by the garden-gate,
through which his brother always
used to pass, coming home.</p>

<p>“Charles now returned home, delighted
with the tune he had just
learned, which he was whistling. He
was scarce come within a short distance
of the gate, when he perceived
the vast spectre, which held out his
arms, and advanced to attack him.
Overcome with terror at the sight of
such an apparition, he fell down, deprived
of understanding. Poor Augustus,
who had not foreseen the consequences
of his fatal frolic, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
threw away his mask, and fell
upon his brother’s almost breathless
body; he tried every means in his
power to re-animate him: but, alas!
the poor little fellow was almost dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="382" height="266" alt="Augustus bent over unconcious Charles; mother running toward them" />
</div>

<p>“In the greatest agony Augustus
called loudly for help, and his parents
instantly came running to the spot.
They carried Charles into the house
and put him to bed, but it was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
time before they could restore animation.
At length he opened his eyes,
and viewed them with a vacant stupid
look. They called him by every tender
name; but he appeared as if he
did not comprehend them. He endeavoured
but in vain, to speak: his
tongue essayed to do so, but without
articulation. He is now deaf, dumb,
and foolish, and will very probably
remain so all his life-time.</p>

<p>“Six or seven months have now
passed away since this melancholy
accident took place, and the doctors
who attend him have no hopes of his
recovery.</p>

<p>“Imagine, my little friends, if you
are able, the distress and sorrow of
his parents. It would certainly have
been better for them and him too, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he had died on the spot. They would
not then have had every day before
them such a piteous object of affliction
and despair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="384" height="271" alt="Charles sitting on stool in corner while Augustus walks around pulling his own hair and looking a fright" />
</div>

<p>“But their distress is nothing in
comparison to Augustus’s. Since the
unfortunate accident, he has fretted
himself to a mere skeleton. He can
neither eat nor sleep. His tears exhaust
him. Twenty times a-day he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
walks about the room, and suddenly
stops short: he wrings his hands,
pulls up his hair, and curses even his
birth. He calls and embraces his
dear brother, who no longer knows
him. I have seen them both, and
cannot tell which of the two is most
unhappy.”</p>
